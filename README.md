A set of Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks to assess the criticality of all road sections in a (national) road network. The code has been developed for the Reublic of Serbia but can be applied to other countries as well. The analysis contains the following steps:
1. Preparation of the road network
2. Criticality assessment that quantifies the impact of the absence for each road section on the network in vehicle and person hours lost and additional kilometres travelled.
3. Accessibility analysis that calculates the access time of population clusters to the nearest emergency services (firefighters, hospitals and police stations)
